        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The development of the current automated decision support has started in 2016.</p>
        <p>In July 2017 a first prototype was shown at the UNCITRAL 50th Session in Vienna. This version focused on dispute resolution.</p>
        <p>Beginning 2018 new tools and standards which became freely available on the market made it possible to 
            shift focus from an IT tool to a datamodel. This free-ed up resources to broaden the legal scope to in-house legal counsel support.</p>

        <h2>Fingerprint technology</h2>
        <p>The datamodel ships with a fingerprint for each combination of answers. 
            This enables to program a webtool to 'jump over' questions for which the answers are already known.</p>
        <p>This unique feature is expected to be a great time-saver, and will motivate decision makers to use the tool.</p>

        <h2>Interactive questionnaire</h2>
        <p>The datamodel is build in such a way that when a question will not lead to an answer it will not be asked.</p>
        <p>This highly efficient method enables parties to make one large model, being ensured that for simple issues only a few answers will be asked.</p>

        <h2>Web ontology</h2>
        <p>The logical decision model is generated in the programming langualge "Ontology Web Language". An open source language.</p>
        <h2>Decision logic</h2>
        <p>The model is checked with a reasoner that works with decision logic.</p>
        <h2>JSON-Schema</h2>
        <p>The datamodel is build following the webstandard <a href="http://json-schema.org/" target="_new">'JSON-Schema'</a>. 
            For many of the programming languages were websites are build in, there are modules that can make nice webforms based on this webstandard.</p>
        <h2>Windows / Mac programs - prototype</h2>
        <p>Shortly Legal LinQ will present a stand-alone windows program for running the datamodel</p>
